# Improve GF's Writing Day by Day

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document records all the English essays authored by my girlfriend Ying Ma, whose dream is getting admitted to the graduate school at Shen Zhen University. She writes every composition by hand carefully, and as you can see, each of them has very nice outward appearance and interesting content. The only drawback is, there are some minor grammatical erros in most of her writings. To be honest, my English writing is not that good to be capable of revising her essays. Fortunately, there is Google which can always help me. I hope my enthusiasm and urge can help encourage her to stick to the last day before the national entrance examination for postgraduate. God bless you.
