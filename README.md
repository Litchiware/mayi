# Improve GF's Writing Day by Day

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document records all the English essays authored by my girlfriend Ying Ma, whose dream is getting admitted to the graduate school at Shen Zhen University. She writes every composition by hand carefully, and as you can see, each of them has very nice outward appearance and interesting content. The only drawback is, there are some minor grammatical erros in most of her writings. To be honest, my English writing is not that good to be capable of revising her essays. Fortunately, there is Google which can always help me. I hope my enthusiasm and urge can help encourage her to stick to the last day before the national entrance examination for postgraduate. God bless you.

Dear Sir or Madam

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to thank you `for offering` me great service in my trip.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very `satisfied with` my trip in the North Sea in last week. I'm sure `my chance` to enjoy `such a` comfortable and exciting holiday should be thanks to your effort. The beach is so beautiful and great, especially with bright sunshine and seawater, and more `satisfyingly`, the homelike room and topping dining room `are both beyond my expectation`. `I will remember the perfect experience forever`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Many thanks to you for all the things you done for me`. Wish you a bright future.

Yours

Li Ming
