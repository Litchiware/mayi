### Revised

Dear friends, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm so moved that you still remember my birthday and `grateful` for your `kindness` to plan a birthday party `for` me. However, I'm afraid I have to decline your offer. As a student, I `have worked` for my life since `entering` university. Notably, a party is a bit too expensive for us. As is `konwn` to all, I had to eat noodles all a week for my 20 years old birthday party. With this in my mind, I plan to go to Central Park `for` mountain climbing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, my feeling can be understood by you and on that day we can go to the park together and have a good time.

Cordially yours

LiMing
