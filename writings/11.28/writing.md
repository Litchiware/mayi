### Revised

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a student in `our` university. I am writing this letter to `make some suggestions about` concerning physical condition of the students.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that many of my `classmates` have `become` remarkably weak. They prefer `playing` computer in the dormitory every day than `going` to the playground to `do exercise`. Therefore, I wonder `whether` the university can do `anything` `to` recover their health. I believe it would be useful to make a strict rule that the students can graduate `only` if they pass sports test(P.E.). Additionally, we will fall in love with sports if we have swimming pools, and so on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure that the physical condition of students can be largely improved with `these` `measures`.

Yours truly

Li Ming

|classmates|这里应该用复数|
|become|become的过去分词仍旧是become|
|palying|prefer doing sth|
|going|prefer doing sth rather than doing，固定句式|
|do exercise|运动：do/take exercise|
|whether|weather是“天气”的意思，“是否”为whether|
