### Revised

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to `invite` you to be a judge for the upcoming English speech contest on the next week.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance `communication` and friendship between `Chinese` and foreign students, the contest will be held. So we need a foreign teacher to make the game more fair. `As we all know`, you are humorous and `professional` `and have been` one of the most popular `teachers`. Remarkably, it's our honour if you come and join us. What you should do `is evaluating` their performance and `encouraging them` in the contest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we will have a nice day, and I really hope that you will accept my invitation.

`Yours`

Li Ming

~~The Student Union~~

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|invite|拼写错误|
|communication|拼写错误|
|Chinese|China指“中国”，Chinese指“中国的”或“中国人”|
|As we all know|这儿并没有转折的意思，用However不合适|
|professional|拼写错误|
|and have been|语法错误，不如直接写成简单句，另外用现在完成时表示“已经成为最受欢迎的老师之一”更恰当些|
|teachers|one of后面都跟名词的复数|
|is evaluating|此处缺少谓语，应该加上is，从而后面的evaluate应该用ing形式|
|encouraging them|这儿也需要用ing形式，另外encourage是及物动词，后面应该有宾语|
|Yours|加上Yours显得礼貌些|
|~~The Student Union~~|多余|
