### Revised

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is vividly described in the picture given above, ~~are~~ four young `people` ~~who~~ are sitting at a table with a lot of delicious and nutritious food. The irony is that they don't enjoy these food `or` ~~didn't have to~~ communicate `with` each other. However, it's a not uncommon social issue, which is significant and realistic and should not be overlooked by every member of society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phenomenon can easily be found anywhere in our daily life. As the economic boom brings not `only` material comfort but fast rhythm of daily life as well, modern citizens, especially these in metropolises are undergoing an unprecedented pressure from work so that they don't have time and enegry to meet friends or attend `parties`. Moreover, the overwhelming use of Internet have prevented our fellow citizens from talking with each other face to face. However, we can't ignore the problem brought by the changes. For example, a lot of young characters prefer to use mobile phones in the online `chatting`, and lose the ability of communicating with each other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, mobile phone do help ~~to~~ us in our life and study, but we should not spent too much time on it. As we know, recognizing a problem is the first step in finding a solution. Thus, I suggest that we shouldn't over `depend` on mobile phone, and then our life will become more real and meaningful.
