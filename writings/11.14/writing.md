Dear Bob

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to share a movie called The Maze Runner `which I have watched` a few days `ago` and want to recommend it to you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a science fiction film that ~~this~~ `tells of` a moving story about several young people`.` The leading man, called Thomas and his team are facing new challenges that the world is coming to the end `because` of the virus invasion, `and` they need to find the truth in the `escape` `using their wisdom`. The movie tells people that hope is everything, and more important, that we need courage like `theirs` to realize `our` dream. In addition, this is my favorite move. I hope you will enjoy it.

Yours truly

Li Ming

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|which I have watched|“我看过的”一部电影，应该用定语从句|
|ago|拼写错误|
|this|that在引导定语从句的同时，也是从句中的主语，因此不需要在从句中再加个this|
|tells of|感觉用tells of比用is更好些|
|.|此处应该用句号，因为后面是完整的句子|
|because|由于病毒入侵，所以世界走到了尽头；而不是世界走到了病毒入侵的尽头|
|and|两个句子之前用逗号隔开的时候，中间要加连词|
|escape|escape表示逃跑，意思更明确些|
|using their wisdom|使用它们的智慧|
|theirs|像他们那样的智慧，theirs代指“他们的智慧”|
|our|与we对应|
