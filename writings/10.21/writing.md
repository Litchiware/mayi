`Dear Sir or Madam`,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to express I want to be a volunteer to serve the earthquake-striken area.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to become a person of positive energy to be able to help others. Certainly, it's `attractive` `for me to work` as a volunteer. It is my dream to help `victims who were` injured and lost their home and family members in the earthquake. Hence, when I saw your enlist notice, I knew it was what I was looking for. In brief, I am `an` unclouded girl who is `adept at communicating` with depressed people to help them `rebuild` their faith. I am sure that this skill is necessary to help quake `survivors`, especially orphan children to `regain` their hope of life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, you can offer me a chance to realize my wish.

Cordially yours

Li Ming
