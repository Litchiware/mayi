Dear Mr Wang

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to you to extend my apologies to `for` my tough decision to quit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days, I find that the work is not what I expected. I really hope that you could take into account my deplorable situation as losing orientation in the work. Honestly speaking, my salary appers remarkably low compared with `other` same-level workers. After all, I have got a bachelor's degree so that I should have `got` a little more. It is a great pity that I have diffculties finding any `opportunities` to `be promoted`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, it takes me a lot of time to make up my mind for departure. Thank you a lot for `giving` me chance to `gain so much precious experience` here in `these` two months. Wish our company a more splendid-shining future.

Cordially yours

Li Ming

|---|---|
|for|为...道歉应该用for而不是to|
|other|拼写错误|
|got|have got是完成时，have 后面怎么能加动词原形“get”呢|
|opportunities|拼写错误，另外oppotunity是可数名词，需要用复数|
|be promoted|被提拔|
|giving|for是介词，后面需要加doing形式|
|gain so much precious|gain是“获得”的意思，achieve是“实现、达到”的意思；experience是不可数名词，后面不能加s；前面也不能用many修饰；well是副词，不能用来修饰experience，可用precious代替，表示“珍贵的”|
