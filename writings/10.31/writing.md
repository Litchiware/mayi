### Revised

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is vividly `depicted` in the picture given above, wistfully and hungeringly, the man in the `first` picture `is` watching an empty bowl `and wants` to fill his stomach, yet in the `second picture` is the other one who is facing ~~to~~ a `bowl filled with` rice but do not dare eat. `The two pictures reflect` a not uncommon social issue, which is significant and realistic and should not be overlooked by every member of the society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our daily life, we can easily find this phenomenon that food quality is increasingly precarious. ~~At the first glance~~ As the economic boom brings not merely material comfort but fast rhythm of daily life as well, modern citizens, especially these in metropolises, are undergoing an unprecendented pressure from work, so what they more and more need `is a` variety of `healthy food` to keep mordern lifestyle. After all, the finite healthy food `leads` to `the situation that` the needs are rising day by day, and can not be satisfied. Considering the issue of food quality, I can think of no better exemplification than `people` over dependent on foreign milk and rice. Therefore, goverment should think of a way to remedy social stability and food safety.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All analyses presented above convince people that measures should be taken to solve `the food quality problem`. `An effective regulatory framework should be provided to ensure the safety of food, and moreover, we need to establish an atomosphere in which the food quality will be paid enough attention to.

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|depicted|参见10.29的作文|
|first|你左边和右边好像搞反了，而且我觉得用first, second更明确些|
|is|此处不是从句，应该去掉that，而且用现在进行时比较好|
|and wants|to do sth一般表示目的，但是这里显然不是表目的，因此用and连接更好些|
|second picture|参见first处的说明|
|~~to~~|此处to多余|
|bowl filled with|盛满...的用filled with...表示|
|The two pictures reflect|前面用first和second picture的话，此处应该是two pictures|
|~~At the first glance~~|这个短语是“第一眼看上去”的意思，不要乱用|
|is a|what they... need 是一个主语从句，主句中缺少谓语，需要加一个is，另外，a variety of表示多种多样，此处缺少a|
|healthy food|此处应该加上healthy使要表达的意思更明确|
|leads|前面food是不可数名词，后面谓语应该用第三人称单数|
|the situation that|lead to后面不能直接跟从句，可以加一个the situation/fact之类的名词，然后再用that引导从句|
|people|拼写错误|
|the food quality problem|应该明确指出it指代的内容|
|An effective ...|自己写，下不为例|
