Dear Mike

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing to tell you of my `decision to accept` the invitation `and participate` in their elder support program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm interested in your elder support program. It is my wish to help lonely old people. Actually, I have been to a rest home to see some old people. I feel very sorry because they are so `lonely`. I gave them gifts to make them happy. I love my parents and hope elders at similar age can live happily.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad that you have offered me chance to realize my wish. Please inform me if `further preparation` are needed.

Yours sincerely

Li Ming

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|decision to accept|decision本身就是决定的意思，没必要再用which I have decided to|
|and participate|“参加...”应该是你决定“decision”的内容，不应该是邀请“invitation”的内容|
|lonely|loneliness是名词，此处应该用形容词|
|further preparation|further是“进一步”的意思，此处更贴切，prepared为动词过去分词，此处应该用名词preparation|
