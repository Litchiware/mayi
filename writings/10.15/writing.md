### Revised

Dear Mike

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing to tell you of my `decision to accept` the invitation `and participate` in their elder support program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm interested in your elder support program. It is my wish to help lonely old people. Actually, I have been to a rest home to see some old people. I feel very sorry because they are so `lonely`. I gave them gifts to make them happy. I love my parents and hope elders at similar age can live happily.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad that you have offered me chance to realize my wish. Please inform me if `further preparation` are needed.

Yours sincerely

Li Ming

### Reviews

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|decision to accept|decision本身就是决定的意思，没必要再用which I have decided to|
|and participate|“参加...”应该是你决定“decision”的内容，不应该是邀请“invitation”的内容|
|lonely|loneliness是名词，此处应该用形容词|
|further preparation|further是“进一步”的意思，此处更贴切，prepared为动词过去分词，此处应该用名词preparation|


### Rivised by Liu Zhuo

Dear Mike

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I'm gald to hear from you.` I `would like to` participate in `your` elder support program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To help elder people has always been my dream.` `Last week I visited some elder people in a local rest home.` `Most of them suffered from several diseases and missed their children. An old lady told me that she hadn't seen her son for a year.` `It makes me feel sad` because they are so lonely. I gave them `some` gifts and hope elders `of my parents' age` can `have a happier life`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I `appreciate that` you `gave` me `the` chance to realize my `dream`. Please inform me if `there are some advance preparation`. `See you soon!`

Yours sincerely

Li Ming

### Reviews of Liu Zhuo's change

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|I'm gald to hear from you.|增加这一句来I'm writing to tell you...来表示这是一封回信|
|would like to paticipate|比my decision to accept the invitation and paticipate更加顺畅和简洁|
|改为your|Mike也是项目一员，应该用your program|
|删了一句|I'm interested in your elder support program.这句话的意思被上一段包含，意义重复|
|To help elder people has always been my dream.|原句It is my wish是强调句，我觉得这里强调愿望本身很重要不太合适，改过后的has always been强调这个愿望很早就有了，更合适一些。另外，dream比wish更加贴切，lonely的含义后文有表现，所以这里不用再重复|
|Last week I visited some elder people in a local nursing home.|Actually表示实际上，用在这里做连接有些别扭，改为具体时间如Last week表示要讲一个自己的故事。另外不应该用过去完成时have been to，应该用过去时。另外主角是疗养院中的老人，谓语为visited some elder people比较恰当。|
|Most of them suffered ...... for a year.|补充几句在疗养院的所见所闻，更加形象，而且顺当地引出下文为他们伤心的情感|
|It makes me feel sad|feel sorry表达难过最好加上对象，如feel sorry for someone。全文多处用到I开头的句子，这里改为It开头，还有承接上文的作用。|
|加入some|give them gifts可能也没错，不过加上some感觉更好|
|hope elders of my parents' age can have a happier life|I love my parents是人人都知道的，可以不用说，这里主要想表达他们和我父母一个年龄。to make them happy与后文意义重复，干脆合为一句。|
|appreciate that|glad的含义与开头重复，而且这里的感情换为appreciate感激更加合适|
|gave|不要乱用过去完成时，用过去时这里|
|the|这个chance就是指之前的那个chance，我感觉也许应该加个定冠词|
|dream|同上，换成dream觉得好一些|
|there are some advance preparation|are needed是个不必要的赘述。further表示其他的，改为advance提前的准备，我觉得更好|
|see you soon|加了一句结尾，可能也没有必要|

注意：在考试中时间有限的情况下估计很难想到这么多，多锻炼语感应该有帮助。我估计我考试的时候也写不了这样的改动。加油！
