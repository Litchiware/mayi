### Revised

Dear Judie,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to you to express my disappointment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have returned to hometown `with hope` after finishing overseas study last month but haven't found a satisfactory job `after all`. I have graduated from a famous `university` and got a Master's degree so that I should have a good job for proving I am excellent. However, reality makes me very disappointed. I gave up many `job opportunities` `to` come `back` to realize my dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I need you `to give` me some advice with regard to the things I should do to find a good job. In addition, thank you for your concern and `willingness to` help me.

Cordially yours

Li Ming

| after all         | 感觉此处after all放到前面比较好                                                          |
| university        | 为什么你的university总是要大写呢                                                         |
| with hope         | 既然with hope是修饰have return to hometown的，我觉得还是放到前边比较好，要不容易引起歧义 |
| job opportunities | 许多工作机会，应该用这个比较好                                                           |
| to                | 此处应该用to，而不是for                                                                  |
| back              | 拼写错误                                                                                 |
| to give           | need sb to do sth                                                                        |
| and               | 前后词性要一致，前面concern是名词，因此后面也应该用名词，willing的名词形式是willingness  |

| and               | 可以用一个并列关系啊，不然这句话to太多了                                                 |
| came              | 改并列句后自然要用过去式                                                                 |
| could             | so that 引导目的状语从句，觉得还是用could 比较好，表示我得到名校的硕士学位目的是能够找到好工作，后面那半句别要了，有点生硬                               |
