Dear Mike,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to you to congratulate you for having built your own enterprise. Certainly, I'm glad that you eagerly pursue your ambition. I'm sure that the final realization of your long-term dream should `owe to` your `nonstop effort`. A lot of dificulty were solved by you before finally `taking` the first step to create your own business. Under the circumstance, the happiness and the bitterness during `building` your company deserve to be `forever` remembered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please accept my `congratulations` again. I `advise` you `hold` your persistence and courge to face challenges in the future. I wish you and your enterprise a more splendid-shinning future.

Cordially yours

Li Ming
