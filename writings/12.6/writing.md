### Revised

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is vividly described in the picture given above, in China, college graduates usually have four choices: `looking` for a job, `going` `abroad` for further study, `taking` part in the entrance exams for postgraduate schools, or `starting` own `undertakings`. These days, the `choices` of college graduates are remarkably more than before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the college `graduates` are facing more and more stern `employment` situation because the number of college graduates `is progressively increasing every year`. So they have to solve the problem by `making` other choices. As students who are about to graduate from college, they have `neither` work experience `nor` well specialized `skills` to compete with others. Therefore, some people choose to go `abroad` or prepare for `postgraduate` school. `Honestly` speaking, it's `a` good `idea` although I think they are escaping the severe social pressure. Obviously, starting a bussiness sounds like a good choice as it can improve one's abilities in all aspect, as well as develop some potential. However, it may make you ~~to~~ have nothing `even` if ~~you~~ one `wrong` move is made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, there isn't `an` only right choice `for` `anyone`. Don't let one failure discourage you. To pursue what you what is the right choice.
