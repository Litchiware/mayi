Dear Sir or Madam

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to you to `express my wish to` `participate in` Project Hope by offering financial aid to a child in a remote area. I hope you can help find a candidate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I have been to a poor mountain village in a remote area last year. `their lives` are `remarkably` difficult. Then, an `excellent but poor` child that has hardly maintained own `study` and life, needs my contribution. In addition, `My plan is` offering `￥5000 in financial aid` every year until he graduated from college by the way of `my` scholarship to encourage him to study hard. I believe the child will become a `good` person that contribute to society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that you can give me a chance to `make my desire come true`. Thank you for your help.

Cordially `yours`

Li Ming
