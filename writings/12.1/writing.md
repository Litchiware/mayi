Dear members

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome you to attend the upcoming club reading session and I hope everyone can `recommend` a book to the club members and share our feeling about the book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will `recommend` a book ~~is~~ called The Dream of Red Mansion. It's my favourite book because it `contains` a lot of philosophy to make me think about life. This book `tells` about four large families `that` have undergone a process of ups and downs, and everyone `in the book` is `real`. Actually, `what touches me most` is `the` love story ~~of~~ throughout the text, and this is `the` most attractive point for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly recommend you to read it and I'm sure you will like it.

Cordially yours

Li Ming
