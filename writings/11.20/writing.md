Dear Students

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As `a member of` Students' Union, I feel so honored `that` you `chose` to visit ~~to~~ our university. Before you come, I would like to offer you some suggestions. Firstly, the campus you are going to stay `at` is very large, so `it will be more convenient for you to rent a bike when you come here`. Secondly, the temperature here is remarkably `lower` than `where` you are from. `So` you may need to bring warm clothes. `Last` but not least, I'm too impatient to wait for `your` arrival.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I` really hope you can have a good time in our beautiful campus. Write to me as soon as possible if you have any questions.

Cordially yours

Li Ming

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|a member of|只能说“作为学生会的一员”，不能说“作文学生会”|
|that|此处用从句更直接|
|chose|choose的过去式是chose|
|~~to~~|visit后面不用跟to|
|at|stay at ...，少了介词at|
|it will be ... here|不能说“你更方便”，只能说“对你来说，...更方便”|
|lower|既然是比较，那就改用比较级|
|where|这儿缺少从句的引导词|
|So|句首应该首字母大写|
|Last|同上|
|your|“你的”到来，应该用your|
|I|句子中有谓语动词hope，因此I'm 中的am多余|
