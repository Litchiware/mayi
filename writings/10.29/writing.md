### Revised

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is vividly `depicted` in the picture given above, a college student, with a textbook `in his hand`, `is studying` how to tie the shoes. The picture reflects a not uncommon social issue, which is significant and realistic and should not be overlooked by every `member` of society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phenomenon can easily be found anywhere in our daily life. As we know, these days, undergraduates only learn the knowledge in schoolbooks and not pay attention to practice. Actually, we live in a over comfortable society, leading to an overwhelming number of people become lazy and do not `think by their own brains`. So much so that, young people of 90's, were defined as a generation `just about to end`. For instance, many students `majoring in education` have studied a lot of professional knowledge but `don't know` how to teach their students. Certainly, the remarkably dangerous trend has to be restained.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All analyses presented above convince people that improving their practical abilities, and getting `their own experience` `are` more `important` `for them` `to adapt to the real society and be their perfect self`. Thus, we should work like Trojans `and` combine book knowledge with practice.
