Dear Bob

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to thank you for your attention during I stay in your house. It's happy experience.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have come back to China, I have found a music CD in my luggage. I'm so sorry about that, I should have checked my luggage before leaving. Please tell me `your` address so that I can mail your cd back to you right away. Additionally, I will present a characteristic music CD as a gift to you, It's one of my favorite -- with Chinese style. I hope you will like it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I'm sorry for my mistake and hope you can forgive me.

Yours 

Li Ming
