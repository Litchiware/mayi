### Revised

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A story full of positive energy often goes like this: ~~as~~ A smart person ~~who~~ should not make `the` same mistake ~~for~~ `twice`. Unfortunately, the man `forgets` `the` truth that he ~~has~~ just `had` a bad fall and `goes` to the wrong `way` again. The truth is `that` `making` `the` same mistake can't be `forgiven`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, `this` cartoon `appears` very urgent to remind us that `we need ` sum up `lessons` in the life, especially ~~why is~~ the cause of failure. A poet said "mistake is called experience" and a physicist said "make all the `mistakes` as soon as possible". It is `the` truth that they have told us about experience and mistake. --we have got experience from mistake to lead to success. However, few people `seriously take` the mistake they have committed in the past. Thus, they usually keep out of the affair. When they face the same diffculty again, even they aren't aware what happened. Hence, people are supposed to make full preparation for `avoiding` ~~result in~~ a negative outcome again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account all resolutions mentioned above, we may safely arrive at a conclution that setting a plan to avoid being stupid again `make you` `closer` to success.
