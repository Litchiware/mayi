&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helplessly and hatefully, a pitiful old father is being kicked just like a football among these evil feet. `It` is `a` remarkably terrible phenomenon that they `are` not willing `to` support their father. ~~However,~~ The picture reflects `a` not uncommon social issue, which is significant and realistic and should not be overlooked by every member of society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cartoon is not an empty warning and it can easily be found anywhere in our daily life. In fact, more and more people now `are` unwilling to take care of their elderly parents. Actually, several factors could weigh heavily for the promotion of the issue. Yet, suspended at the top of the list are the following two `causes`. To begin with, people now are busier ~~with~~ earning a living than past time, `and` they `spend` more time on work and study. Thus, they haven't spare time to `accompany` their `parents`. Another factor we `cann't` `ignore` is that when people grow old, they often become remarkably physically week and unable to take care of `theirselves`. Most of the time, they need to be attended. So we can understand why more and more middle-aged people choose to escape from `taking` care of their parents.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, busyness can never be a reason `not to` look after one's own parents. The goverment should improve the national elderly support system to make the `elders` can live a comfortable life. Public media should educate the people that caring `for` their old parents is more important than any `other` `undertakings`.
