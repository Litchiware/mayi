Dear Sir or Madam

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to you to express my concern about historical sites in our city.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economic boom brings not merely material comfort but the disaster of civilization. Admittedly, these days, fast rhythm of urban construction `leads to the situation that` `historical` sites are being `adversely` affected, with some seriously breached `and some even` completely destroyed. It's a disaster `on` human civilization. The history of hometown will be hard to understand by our future generation unless all mark of civilization `preserved`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I strongly `recommend` that the goverment take effective `measures` to `solve` these `problems`. I'm looking forward `to` seeing that a solution can be archieved as soon as possible.

Cordially Yours

Li Ming

|---|---|
|leads to the situation that|to是介词不能做谓语，lead to the situation/fact that...表示导致...的发生|
|historical|拼写错误|
|adversely|示例作文中的adversely是要表达历史遗迹遭到“严重地”破坏，你所用的“barely”却表示的是“未遭到破坏”|
|and some even|这儿我觉得需要加个and，并且even放到some后面感觉更通顺|
|on|disaster on ...固定搭配|
|preserved|“除非历史遗迹被保留下来，否则后代将难以理解我们的历史文化”，这个地方应该是要用“保留”而不是“消失”|
|recommend|拼写错误|
|measures|单复数错误|
|solve|拼写错误，resole是“溶解”的意思|
|problems|单复数错误|
|to|look forward to doing，少了一个to|
