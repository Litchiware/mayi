Dear Sir or `Madam`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to express my brief opinions that restrictions on the use of plastic bags have not been so successful in some regions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, "white pollution" is still going on. The importance of `environment` protection not be realized `by` some people, `leads` to "white pollution" `becoming` more and more serious. So, it is remarkably better to replace plastic bags and disposable `canteens` with `environmental ones`. In newspaper, it should be strongly advocated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the earth more beautiful. I believe this is our common aspiration.

`Cordially` yours

Li Ming
