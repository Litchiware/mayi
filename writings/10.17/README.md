Dear Frank

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing this letter to highly recommend the discussion meeting over Sino-America Cultural Differences hold at the 
International Communication Center on December 28, 2015. You will certainly find this activity attractive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, in order to create `a platform` for American students and Chinese students to know each other and develop friendship, this `will be held`. Then, they will not `be distant` any longer. In particular, you are remarkably interested in `Chinese culture, so` I think the meeting should not be missed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, `I believe` you will be `interested in it` and choose to attend it.

Cordially yours

Li Ming
