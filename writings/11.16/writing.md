Dear Bob

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimistically and corporately, two disabled people that `they` go ahead bravely and `support` each other after they throw away their crutches. This is a moving story. However, such a story reflects a not `uncommon` social issue, which is significant and realistic and should `not` be overlooked by every member of society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our daily life, we can easily find this phenomenon that `more and more people` attach importance to cooperation `to` achieve their own purposes. Actually, every `person`, ~~and~~ every team, even ~~to the end~~ every country has own advantages and disadvantages. In order `that` the development can be better achieved, `we` must collaborate with each other and achieve win-win. As shown in the picture, the sound leg of each disabled person is their advantage, and the crippled one is their disadvantage. Considering the issue of cooperation, I can think of no better exemplification than the relationship between the `goverment` and investors`. The` goverment need a lot of money `to build` highways and `constrct` the city, `and` obviously, investors need to depend on `chance` of investment to make money.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All analyses presented above convince people that we should strengthen cooperation consciousness `and learn virtues` of others to make up for our deficiencies.

|改动句子|改动说明|
|---|---|
|they|that引导定语从句的同时也是从句的主语，因此此处they多余|
|support|拼写错误|
|uncommon|not uncommon表示很常见，双重否定表示肯定|
|not|不应该被忽视，意思表达反了|
|more and more people|越来越多的人...|
|to|to do sth表示目的，for后面应该接doing|
|person|person 与后面的team、country对应|
|and|此处and多余|
|to the extend|多余，不知所云|
|that|that来引导后面的句子|
|we|此处缺少主语|
|goverment|拼写错误|
|. The|此处一句话结束，应该用句号，后面的The首字母大写|

|and|此处需要用连词and来连接前后两个句子|
|chance|chance本身是名词，不需要加ing|
